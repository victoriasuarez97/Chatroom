# Le Chat Room 🐈

<b>Le Chat Room</b> is a chat app with users and rooms, created with Vainilla JS, NodeJS, Socket.io and Express.

This is the result of a code along of Traversy Media tutorial "Realtime chat with users & rooms - Socket.io, Node & Express".

## To run this app

First, you have to install the dependencies from the node_modules folder. To do that, add a new terminal on your IDE and type:
``npm i``

After this has finished installing, all you have to do is type:
``npm run dev``

Now you have <b>Le Chat Room</b> running on localhost:3000 ✨🤠
All that is left to do is choose a name to be shown with your messages and the room you want to enter.

Hope you enjoy it 💖
